# Rules of chess that will help you to improve your game even if you don't know the theory
Before I get into these rules, understand that, without knowing theory, you cannot become an exceptionally good player. However, there are a lot of players who study theory (myself included), but often do not follow the most basic rules of chess. Whether you want to spend time studying theory, or you just want to play chess for fun, you should follow these rules. I am writing these rules because I know them, yet I catch myself playing too fast and forgetting about them. If you do that too, maybe this will help.

1.  Before you play a move, ask yourself "Why am I playing this move?"
2.  After your opponent plays a move, ask yourself "Why did he/she play this move?"
3.  Always have a plan.
4.  If you decided to play a move, ask yourself "What will my opponent play after my move?" Consider 3 best replies. If even one puts you in a bad position, do not play the move.
5.  Before you play a move, look at your position:  
  - Do you have any undefended pieces?  
  - Is any of your opponent's pieces attacking any of your pieces with more attackers than you have defenders? If not, can he do it on the next move?  
  - Are any of your pieces pinned? If yes, can you unpin it safely?  
  - Is any of the opponent's pieces x-raying your King or Queen?  
  - Is your opponent able to take a piece that defends another one of your pieces, and once you recapture he can take the undefended piece?  
  - Is any of your pieces stuck, meaning there are no available places where it can go without being captured?  
6. Now look at your opponent's position and ask the same questions.
aluate the position of the pieces.  
  `ROOKS:` Are your rooks controlling open or semi-open files or your opponent's? Are your rooks connected?  
  `BISHOPS:` Is your bishop blocked by your pieces or your opponent's protected pawns? Can you move it to a better position? How many diagonals is your bishop targeting, 1, 2, 3, or 4? If there is a potential bishop/pawn ending happening after exchanging other minor pieces, is your bishop better than the opponents? If they are of the same color, can your bishop attack the opponent's pawns, or are they positioned on the fields of the opposite color? Try to block the opponent's pawns with your pawns so they are stuck on the fields of the same color as your bishop. If you cannot do that, or if your opponent did that to you, try to avoid bishop endgame, exchange them if possible.  
  `KNIGHTS:` Are your knights at the edge files or center files? Can you fork any pieces? Can your opponent fork any of your pieces?  
  `PAWNS:` Do you have more pawn islands than your opponent? Do you have any isolated pawns? Are you able to protect them? Do you have any passed pawns on the 6th or 7th rank? Are they protected? What about your opponent's pawns?  
  `QUEEN:` Is your Queen blocked by your pieces or your opponent's protected pawns? Can you move it to a better position? How many diagonals is your Queen targeting, 1, 2, 3, or 4? Always have a safe space for your queen if you need to move back. Is your Queen active more than your opponent's Queen?  
  `KING:` During the opening and middle game, is your king protected with pawns and pieces, or is it exposed? Is your king exposed while the opponent castled? During the endgame, is your king closer to the center than the opponent's king?
  
Analyze your games in a chess engine. If you lost, replay the game and see where did you make a mistake. You don't have to remember the position, but try to understand why that was a mistake.  
For the end, here are a couple of don'ts you should try to avoid.  

1. If you wish to improve in chess, avoid bullet and blitz games. You don't have enough time to ask all of these questions and evaluate the position. Play rapid and classic games with increment. If you are just playing for fun, play any time format you want. if you don't have time to play long games, try to find the time when you can. Even one long game every week will help you.  
2. Do not premove during openings or middlegame, unless you are really good at chess. Winning a couple of seconds is not worth it if you are going to play moves without following the above-mentioned rules.  
3. Do not make it your goal to win on time. If you have a bad position and win on time, you didn't improve or even play a good game. You just won a few points that you will lose in one of the next games.  
4. During openings, avoid playing the same move order no matter what your opponent plays.  
5. Do not be a poor player. Poor players laugh at others when they blunder or lose a won game, or they abandon games without resigning.  
6. Do not care about your rating. Do not fear losing your points. If you are good, you will have a good rating. If you are not good, you will have a bad rating, that is the truth.  
7. If you want to improve in chess, do not play for tricks. It will work only against weaker players. Tricks and gambits are fun, and they can work, but it's important to know when to do it. If you intentionally play for tricks, you will lose more games than you win. Instead, try to recognize a mistake in your opponent's defense, and if the trick or a gambit presents itself, use it. However, it is important to know the tricks, so you avoid falling into one.  
8. If you had a long game and you are mentally exhausted after it, take a 5-10 minute break. It will help you relax before the next game. People often play a bunch of games in a row, and their concentration and focus go down after some time, so they start rushing.  

I hope that these rules help you improve your game. Even if you don't know the theory, you will still play good chess (to a certain level). When you learn theory, your game will be substantially better because you are backing it up with these rules. Remember, 3 key things for every good chess player are patience, focus, and concentration. Best of luck!
