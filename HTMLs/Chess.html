    will help you to improve your game even if you don&#8217;t know the theory</h1>
    <p><strong>Posted by: </strong><em> u/njeshko</em> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a></p>
    <p>Before I get into these rules, understand that, without knowing theory, you cannot become an exceptionally good
    player. However, there are a lot of players who study theory (myself included), but often do not follow the most
    basic rules of chess. Whether you want to spend time studying theory, or you just want to play chess for fun, you
    should follow these rules. I am writing these rules because I know them, yet I catch myself playing too fast and
    forgetting about them. If you do that too, maybe this will help.</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Before you play a move, ask yourself &#8220;Why am I playing this move?&#8221;</li>
    <li>After your opponent plays a move, ask yourself &#8220;Why did he/she play this move?&#8221;</li>
    <li>Always have a plan.</li>
    <li>If you decided to play a move, ask yourself &#8220;What will my opponent play after my move?&#8221; Consider 3
      best replies. If even one puts you in a bad position, do not play the move.</li>
    <li>Before you play a move, look at your position:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>Do you have any undefended pieces?<br />
        </li>
        <li>Is any of your opponent&#8217;s pieces attacking any of your pieces with more attackers than you have
          defenders? If not, can he do it on the next move?<br />
        </li>
        <li>Are any of your pieces pinned? If yes, can you unpin it safely?<br />
        </li>
        <li>Is any of the opponent&#8217;s pieces x-raying your King or Queen?<br />
        </li>
        <li>Is your opponent able to take a piece that defends another one of your pieces, and once you recapture he can
          take the undefended piece?<br />
        </li>
        <li>Is any of your pieces stuck, meaning there are no available places where it can go without being
          captured?<br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Now look at your opponent&#8217;s position and ask the same questions. aluate the position of the pieces.<br />
      <code>ROOKS:</code> Are your rooks controlling open or semi-open files or your opponent&#8217;s? Are your rooks
      connected?<br />
      <code>BISHOPS:</code> Is your bishop blocked by your pieces or your opponent&#8217;s protected pawns? Can you move
      it to a better position? How many diagonals is your bishop targeting, 1, 2, 3, or 4? If there is a potential
      bishop/pawn ending happening after exchanging other minor pieces, is your bishop better than the opponents? If
      they are of the same color, can your bishop attack the opponent&#8217;s pawns, or are they positioned on the
      fields of the opposite color? Try to block the opponent&#8217;s pawns with your pawns so they are stuck on the
      fields of the same color as your bishop. If you cannot do that, or if your opponent did that to you, try to avoid
      bishop endgame, exchange them if possible.<br />
      <code>KNIGHTS:</code> Are your knights at the edge files or center files? Can you fork any pieces? Can your
      opponent fork any of your pieces?<br />
      <code>PAWNS:</code> Do you have more pawn islands than your opponent? Do you have any isolated pawns? Are you able
      to protect them? Do you have any passed pawns on the 6th or 7th rank? Are they protected? What about your
      opponent&#8217;s pawns?<br />
      <code>QUEEN:</code> Is your Queen blocked by your pieces or your opponent&#8217;s protected pawns? Can you move it
      to a better position? How many diagonals is your Queen targeting, 1, 2, 3, or 4? Always have a safe space for your
      queen if you need to move back. Is your Queen active more than your opponent&#8217;s Queen?<br />
      <code>KING:</code> During the opening and middle game, is your king protected with pawns and pieces, or is it
      exposed? Is your king exposed while the opponent castled? During the endgame, is your king closer to the center
      than the opponent&#8217;s king?
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Analyze your games in a chess engine. If you lost, replay the game and see where did you make a mistake. You
    don&#8217;t have to remember the position, but try to understand why that was a mistake.<br />
    For the end, here are a couple of don&#8217;ts you should try to avoid.</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>If you wish to improve in chess, avoid bullet and blitz games. You don&#8217;t have enough time to ask all of
      these questions and evaluate the position. Play rapid and classic games with increment. If you are just playing
      for fun, play any time format you want. if you don&#8217;t have time to play long games, try to find the time when
      you can. Even one long game every week will help you.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Do not premove during openings or middlegame, unless you are really good at chess. Winning a couple of seconds
      is not worth it if you are going to play moves without following the above-mentioned rules.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Do not make it your goal to win on time. If you have a bad position and win on time, you didn&#8217;t improve or
      even play a good game. You just won a few points that you will lose in one of the next games.<br />
    </li>
    <li>During openings, avoid playing the same move order no matter what your opponent plays.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Do not be a poor player. Poor players laugh at others when they blunder or lose a won game, or they abandon
      games without resigning.<br />
    </li>
    <li>Do not care about your rating. Do not fear losing your points. If you are good, you will have a good rating. If
      you are not good, you will have a bad rating, that is the truth.<br />
    </li>
    <li>If you want to improve in chess, do not play for tricks. It will work only against weaker players. Tricks and
      gambits are fun, and they can work, but it&#8217;s important to know when to do it. If you intentionally play for
      tricks, you will lose more games than you win. Instead, try to recognize a mistake in your opponent&#8217;s
      defense, and if the trick or a gambit presents itself, use it. However, it is important to know the tricks, so you
      avoid falling into one.<br />
    </li>
    <li>If you had a long game and you are mentally exhausted after it, take a 5-10 minute break. It will help you relax
      before the next game. People often play a bunch of games in a row, and their concentration and focus go down after
      some time, so they start rushing.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I hope that these rules help you improve your game. Even if you don&#8217;t know the theory, you will still play
    good chess (to a certain level). When you learn theory, your game will be substantially better because you are
    backing it up with these rules. Remember, 3 key things for every good chess player are patience, focus, and
    concentration. Best of luck!</p>
